# Ultrawide Please

Browser plugin to remove black bars from 21:9 content for optimal viewing on
ultrawide monitors.

Primarily built for my own use so I can trust the code that's running in my browser.
Currently zero effort on docs & user friendliness.

## Usage
`ctrl + alt + c ` Enables ultrawide mode when a video is fullscreen'd
